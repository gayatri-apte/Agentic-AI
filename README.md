Personal AI Chatbot

This project is a personal AI assistant that represents me (Gayatri Apte) on my website. It uses my LinkedIn profile and a summary document to answer questions about my background, skills, and experience.

The chatbot runs locally with Ollama (Llama model) and is accessible via a Gradio web interface. It can also record user details or unknown questions by sending notifications through Pushover.
